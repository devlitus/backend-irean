## Instructions

**All development instructions are in**:

1. **Project conventions & architecture**: [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](../.github/copilot-instructions.md) - Workflows, database setup, deployment, naming conventions
2. **Strapi coding patterns**: [`.github/instructions/strapi-instructions.md`](../.github/instructions/strapi-instructions.md) - Controllers, services, routes, schemas, best practices

These are the single source of truth for this project.
